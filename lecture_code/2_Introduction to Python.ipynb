    "**IPython Magic**: Python offers some meta services as a part of the runtime environment which can be very helpful. For example, the autoload command below automatically detects if some library code being imported by this notebook has changed or not. If any changes are detected, they are automatically reloaded (if you do not use this magic command then the old version will continue to be used). This is helpful if you are writing some of the libraries yourself and testing them using a Jupyter notebook or an IPython interface and you wish to avoid reloading your libraries again and again after making every tiny change."

    "**Python Packages**: it is quite common to give packages handy nicknames while importing them. In fact, some of these nicknames are quite standard, for example _np_ for the _numpy_ package, _plt_ for the _pyplot_ package, etc. However, nothing will break if you choose some other nickname and use that nickname consistently. It is just that people will recognize your code more easily if you use standard nicknames. Nicknames for other packages may be non-standard and you are free to use nicknames that are both descriptive, as well as short.\n",

However, I prefer the C-style naming convention that uses capitalization instead. For example, the method name used below is _helloWorld_ whereas a conventional naming style would have used the name _hello\\_world_ instead. Feel free to use a convention that suits your style and taste."

Multiline comments are effected using a funny workaround by styling them as triple quoted strings. Due to the manner in which the Python interpreter works, if it encounters a stray string in the middle of the program, it ignores it (unless it is placed strategically as a docstring) and thus, the string effectively functions as a comment."
